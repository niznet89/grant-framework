## Project Overview 

- Project: Tali AI
- Team Name: Tali AI 

### Overview

- **A brief description of the project.**

We propose to develop a private bot or a widget for EOS, leveraging the power of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). This tool would integrate various resources such as EOS's Github repositories, documentation, associated articles, and Q&A history, creating an interface where users can ask questions in a natural language. The primary objective is to enhance Developer Relations, Customer Support, and Community Support within the EOS ecosystem. This solution would streamline the support process and expedite responses to frequently asked questions, fostering a better user experience and more effective utilization of support resources.

- **Why build this?**

Our team recognizes the increasing importance of blockchain technology and the pivotal role EOS plays in this domain, specifically with its scalable blockchain platform focused on fast and free transactions, smart contracts, and secure data management. We believe that enhancing developer and community support for EOS will play a significant role in broadening its adoption and fostering a more vibrant ecosystem.

EOS's expansive documentation and active community present an ideal environment for our proposed project. With its unique focus on both business applications and individual users, the EOS platform presents a challenging and exciting opportunity for us to create a tool that can significantly benefit both these sectors.

Our team, led by Ali Agha and Tenzin Rose, has considerable experience in decentralized solutions and delivering quality technical solutions. This project aligns with our expertise and our vision of advancing blockchain technology. We are committed to creating a more equitable world through the power of decentralization, and we see EOS as an essential component of that vision.

## Development Roadmap 

### Development Roadmap for Tali Bot/Widget

#### Overview

|                   | Milestone 1 | Milestone 2 | Total  |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Estimated Duration| 2 weeks     | 2 weeks     | 4 weeks|
| Cost (up to $ 7,500)| $3,750     | $3,750     | $7,500 |

#### Milestone 1 — Implementation of Data Sources

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 0a.    | Documentation | We will provide a basic tutorial on how to interact with the bot/widget using different data sources. |
| 1      | Data Source Integration | We will integrate 3-4 high-value data sources into the bot/widget. This will include EOS's Github repositories, documentation, related articles, and Q&A history. |
| 2      | Index Creation | We will use the Llama Index to create indices and a vector database to facilitate embeddings-based search on queries. |
| 3.     | Deployment to private Discord server where members of the EOS team & community can test out Tali. The team will be asked to up / down vote responses for future training |

#### Milestone 2  —  Testing, Optimization, and Deployment

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 0b.    | Documentation | We will update the existing documentation to cover new features and optimizations. |
| 1      | Bot/Widget Testing and Optimization | We will focus on eliminating any hallucinations and refining the bot's/widget's prompt engineering to ensure it gives only relevant answers. |
| 2      | Deployment | The bot/widget will be production-ready and approved by the Customer / Community Support teams. It will be ready for deployment on EOS's support channels. |
| 3      | Bot learning | Based on team / community responses from initial deployment, custom data will be provided to Tali to help answer future questions. |


## Future Plans

Our team envisions the Tali Bot/Widget as a multi-faceted tool that grows with the needs of the EOS community and continues to be a key resource for developers, customers, and the broader community.

**Long-Term Project Plans:**

React & Vanilla JS Widget: We plan to develop a widget using React and Vanilla JS, providing a component that can be easily added to the EOS documentation page. This widget will be interactive, allowing users to ask questions directly on the docs page and receive instant responses, thus enhancing the accessibility and usability of our tool.

Analytics Suite: We recognize the value of data-driven insights in shaping a project's growth. We intend to implement an analytics suite that will track the types of questions the community is asking, enabling us to continuously improve the bot's responses and understand the community's needs better.

Knowledge Graphs: We plan to delve deeper into the understanding of the EOS codebases by creating knowledge graphs. These graphs will help the bot understand complex queries better, leading to more accurate and contextually aware responses.

**Operation Plans:**

We are committed to regular maintenance and updates to keep the bot's knowledge up-to-date and its performance optimal. We will periodically engage with the EOS community, gather feedback, and iterate on the bot's features and functionalities. This includes refining our algorithms, updating our data sources, and enhancing our user interface based on user feedback and needs.

**Intention:**

Our overarching intention is to create a product-driven solution where customers can self-serve effectively and efficiently. We want Tali to be a robust and reliable tool for all users, from novice developers to experienced ones, to community members who are interested in EOS's growth and development. Additionally, we recognize that some users might require custom implementations to better suit their needs.
